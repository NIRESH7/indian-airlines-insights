✈️ Indian Airlines Data Analytics Dashboard
📁 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes Indian airline data to uncover insights about airport metrics, regional distribution, elevation patterns, and overall aviation trends. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding aviation infrastructure and operations.

✅ Objectives
Analyze airport distribution by region, country, and type

Visualize geospatial airport data with map integration

Track airport scores, elevation, and coordinates

Understand type distribution (e.g., small vs. medium airports)

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for intuitive exploration

📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains information about airports in India, including:

Airport Name

Local Region

ISO Region

ISO Country

Continent

Latitude & Longitude

Elevation (in feet)

Airport Type

Score (aggregated metric)

🔒 Note: Data is either publicly available or anonymized for academic use.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

Excel / CSV – Data preparation and cleanup

SQL (optional) – For structured queries (if applicable)

Python (Pandas, NumPy) (optional) – For additional data manipulation

📈 Key Insights
